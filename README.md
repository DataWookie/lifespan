# Lifespan Package

## Births

Interest in this project was initiated by [this post](http://www.livescience.com/32728-baby-month-is-almost-here-.html) which suggests that the most babies are born in the US during August and that the least are born in February. The latter makes logical sense, while the cause for the former is open for speculation.

Data were derived from the [National Center for Health Statistics](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm). The data can be accessed directly from the [CDC Anonymous FTP site](ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/natality/).

## Mortality

The mortality data were also acquired from the [CDC Anonymous FTP site](ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/DVS/mortality/). The metadata for the mortality data can be found [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_public_use_data.htm).
